This folder is for long-term exploration, development, and all that jazz. Any code repositories will live here as subfolders, but other subfolders can be dedicated to purely conceptual work as well. 

Consider using tags as well:  "#idea", "#experiment", "#archived", etc., are a nice alternative to subfolders for top-down organization
