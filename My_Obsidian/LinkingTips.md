title: Linking_Tips
---

|Do…|Don’t…|
|---|---|
|Use **relative links** (`[[4_Resources/Note]]`)|Hard-code absolute paths (fragile if you move vault)|
|Cite Resources in Projects as “background”|Dump whole paragraphs—prefer brief context + link|
|Create **MOCs (Maps of Content)** to group notes|Link every note to every note → visual chaos|
|Transclude only small blocks (`>! [[Note#Block]]`)|Transcluding huge sections (makes Projects heavy)|
|Tag Resource notes by theme (`#pattern`, `#theory`)|Tag Projects or Dailies—keep tags for evergreen|
