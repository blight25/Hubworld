title: Zettlekasten
---
Stores well-defined, atomic notes that are richly linked between each other. This "evergreen" can be referenced by other notes, but will stay in their own space. 

All notes should be marked with a "#zettel", which will allow for easy graph-view filtering so that only the Zettlekasten notes are shown.
